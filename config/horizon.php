             * NINETY-SIX, BECAUSE 128 HERE COULD NEVER FIRE AGAINST PHP'S 128
             * (P3.5-T17)
             * ---------------------------------------------------------------
             * This was 128, the same number as PHP's default `memory_limit`,
             * and that coincidence disabled the recycle entirely. Laravel
             * checks this ceiling AFTER a job returns (`Worker::runJob()` then
             * `stopIfNecessary()`), so a graceful restart requires a worker to
             * FINISH a job already holding 128 MiB — which the identical PHP
             * limit makes impossible. The allocation that would cross the line
             * throws `Allowed memory size of 134217728 bytes exhausted` inside
             * the render instead, and the check is never reached.
             *
             * That is what T11 and T13 both logged during the receipt drain,
             * in mPDF's TTFontFile.php. Every PDF still arrived, because the
             * job retries — so the cost was wasted renders and noise, not lost
             * documents.
             *
             * MEASURED, NOT ESTIMATED. Twenty-five receipts rendered back to
             * back in one process: the worker starts near 42 MiB, the first
             * render adds 22 MiB as mPDF loads and subsets its fonts, and
             * every render after that adds about 2 MiB which is never
             * released. At render 25 the process held 114 MiB and was still
             * climbing linearly, so exhaustion arrives near render 32 — about
             * what a 2,770-receipt drain over three workers would hit roughly
             * thirty times each.
             *
             * SO THE RENDER'S COST IS NOT THE DEFECT; THE UNREACHABLE CEILING
             * IS. Raising PHP's limit alone would only move the render at
             * which a worker dies, because the growth is accumulation rather
             * than one expensive render.
             *
             * 96 leaves 32 MiB beneath PHP's default — more than the largest
             * single-render cost ever observed here (the 22 MiB cold start),
             * so a worker that reaches the ceiling can still finish the job in
             * hand and be recycled before the next one. It yields roughly
             * seventeen receipts per worker lifetime.
             *
             * THE INVARIANT, NOT THE NUMBER, IS WHAT MATTERS: this must stay
             * below the `memory_limit` the workers actually run under, with
             * room for one more render. `ReceiptGenerationTest` asserts it.
             * `maxJobs` was the alternative and is deliberately left at 0 — a
             * job count would hardcode today's per-render cost, while this
             * adapts if the render gets cheaper or dearer.
