# Engineering Standards

Single source of truth for coding conventions. Both `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` reference this file — do not duplicate its content into either.

**Target:** Laravel 11+ (latest stable), PHP 8.3+, Filament, MySQL.

## Applying Laravel best practices to a Filament app

Standard Laravel guidance is written for API-first applications. This project is a server-rendered Filament admin panel plus Blade public pages. The following table records which conventions apply and which do not, so nobody re-litigates it per pull request.

| Convention | Applies here? | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Action classes | **Yes** | Every non-trivial write operation is an Action. Filament resources call Actions. |
| DTOs | **Yes** | Structured data into Actions and Services. Plain readonly PHP classes. |
| Services | **Yes** | Cross-domain orchestration and published interfaces between domains. |
| Policies | **Yes** | Every model has a Policy. Filament Shield generates the baseline. |
| Backed enums + model casts | **Yes** | All status columns. |
| Form Requests | **Blade surfaces only** | Filament validates in its own schema definitions. Do not force Form Requests into Filament resources. |
| API Resources | **Not yet** | No API exists in phases 1–4. Use them if one is added. |
| Repository layer | **No** | Filament's table and form builders consume Eloquent query builders directly. A repository between Filament and Eloquent fights the framework for no benefit. Query scopes on models instead. |
| Sanctum / Passport | **No** | Session auth via Filament panels. |

## Architecture

- **Thin controllers, fat actions.** Controllers handle HTTP only. Zero business logic.
- **No business logic in models.** Relationships, scopes, casts, and accessors only.
- **Domain organization.** Code lives under `app/Domain/{Enrollment,Finance,Staff,Content}/`, not in a flat `app/Models` + `app/Services` split.
- **Cross-domain access goes through a published service interface.** Finance reads enrollment data via `EnrollmentQueryService`, never by querying `enrollments` directly.
- **One class, one purpose.** When a file grows past roughly 300 lines, that is a signal it is doing too much.

```
app/Domain/Enrollment/
├── Actions/          # EnrollStudentAction, IssueCertificateAction
├── Data/             # DTOs
├── Enums/            # EnrollmentStatus, BatchStatus
├── Exceptions/       # Typed domain exceptions
├── Models/           # Student, Course, Batch, Enrollment
├── Policies/
├── Services/         # Published cross-domain interfaces
└── Filament/         # Resources, pages, widgets for this domain
```

## Database

- Every foreign key gets a real constraint with explicit `onDelete`: `restrictOnDelete()` for anything financial, `cascadeOnDelete()` only for genuine child records.
- Index every foreign key, and every column used in `WHERE` or `ORDER BY`. Composite indexes for common query pairs.
- Money is `decimal(12, 3)`. **Never float, never `decimal(12,2)`.** The currency is LYD, which subdivides into 1000 dirham per ISO 4217. Two decimal places would silently round dirham-precision amounts and break reconciliation. Display precision is a UI concern, not a storage one.
- Status columns are `string(30)` with a `default`, an index, and a backed enum cast.
- Explicit nullability on every column.
- One migration per logical change. Never edit a migration that has run in production.
- **No derived values stored.** Balances and totals are computed from source rows, never cached into a column.

---

## Authorization

- Permission-based, never role-based, in code: `$user->can('students.delete')`. **Never** `$user->hasRole('admin')`.
- No `role` column on `users` — Spatie's pivot tables own role assignment.
- Every model has a Policy. Every Filament resource is gated by it.
- The three escalation guards are enforced in Policies and covered by tests:
  1. An admin cannot create, edit, or delete a super admin.
  2. No user can modify their own roles or permissions.
  3. The last active super admin cannot be deleted or deactivated.

---

## Error handling

- Typed custom exceptions carrying context, not generic `\Exception`.
- Multi-table operations run in `DB::transaction()`.
- Domain exceptions render as readable UI messages. Stack traces never reach users.
- Dispatch queued jobs with `afterCommit()` when dispatching inside a transaction.

---

## Testing

Feature tests over unit tests — the risk in this system is in how pieces connect.

- `RefreshDatabase` on every feature test.
- Factories with states for all test data.
- `Mail::fake()`, `Queue::fake()`, `Event::fake()`. Never hit real external services.
- **Every permission test asserts both the positive and the negative** — what a role can do *and* what it cannot. Negative assertions are where authorization bugs hide.
- Test unhappy paths as thoroughly as happy paths.

A task is not complete until its tests pass. Report actual test output; never claim passing tests without running them.

---

## Security

- `$fillable` on every model. Never `$guarded = []`.
- `config('key')` in application code. Never `env()` outside config files.
- Rate-limit all public and auth endpoints.
- Sanitize any user-supplied content rendered as HTML.
- `.env` stays out of version control.

---

## Internationalization

Enforced from the first commit, even though Arabic strings arrive in phase 4:

- **No hardcoded user-facing strings.** Everything goes through `lang/` files.
- **Logical CSS properties only** — `margin-inline-start`, `padding-inline-end`, `text-align: start`. Never `margin-left`, `padding-right`, `text-align: left`.
- Test any new layout at `dir="rtl"` before considering it done.

## Tooling

| Purpose | Tool |
|---|---|
| Formatting | Laravel Pint — must pass before commit |
| Static analysis | Larastan — must pass before commit |
| Testing | Pest |
| RBAC | `spatie/laravel-permission` + Filament Shield |
| Activity log | `spatie/laravel-activitylog` |
| Backups | `spatie/laravel-backup` |

## Commits

- Conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `docs:`, `chore:`.
- Reference the task ID: `feat(enrollment): add batch instructor hour allocation [P1-T06]`.
- Never commit with failing tests, Pint violations, or Larastan errors.
